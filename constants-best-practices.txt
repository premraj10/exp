In Java Spring Boot, the best practice for storing constant variables is to use a `class` with `static final` variables, rather than an `interface`. The use of interfaces for constants is generally discouraged as it breaks the principle of "interface segregation" by mixing contracts with implementation details.

### Why Use a Class with Static Final Variables:
- **Separation of Concerns**: A class is meant for defining behavior and state. Constants are considered state, so placing them in a class makes sense.
- **Avoid Interface Inheritance**: By using an interface for constants, classes that implement that interface will inherit these constants. This practice can lead to unwanted pollution of the namespace and confusion over what methods need to be implemented.
- **Clearer Structure**: Using a class provides a clear distinction between constants and the actual logic of the application.

### Best Practices for Organizing Constants:
If you have many constants, it’s a good idea to segregate them by purpose or category to keep your code organized and readable.

#### 1. **Constants Class per Module**:
   - Create separate classes for different modules or concerns. For example:
     ```java
     public class ApiConstants {
         public static final String BASE_URL = "/api/v1";
         public static final int TIMEOUT = 5000;
     }
     
     public class SecurityConstants {
         public static final String TOKEN_PREFIX = "Bearer ";
         public static final String HEADER_STRING = "Authorization";
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Nested Classes for Grouping**:
   - You can group constants within a single class using nested static classes.
     ```java
     public class Constants {
         public static class Api {
             public static final String BASE_URL = "/api/v1";
             public static final int TIMEOUT = 5000;
         }
         
         public static class Security {
             public static final String TOKEN_PREFIX = "Bearer ";
             public static final String HEADER_STRING = "Authorization";
         }
     }
     ```

#### 3. **Enum for Grouped Constants**:
   - For related constants, consider using `enum`. This is especially useful when you have a set of constant values that naturally belong together, such as configuration values or state indicators.
     ```java
     public enum UserRole {
         ADMIN, USER, GUEST;
     }
     ```

### Example Structure:
Here’s how you can organize constants in a Spring Boot application:
```java
// ApiConstants.java
public class ApiConstants {
    public static final String BASE_URL = "/api/v1";
    public static final int TIMEOUT = 5000;
}

// SecurityConstants.java
public class SecurityConstants {
    public static final String TOKEN_PREFIX = "Bearer ";
    public static final String HEADER_STRING = "Authorization";
}

// MessageConstants.java
public class MessageConstants {
    public static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = "An error occurred";
    public static final String SUCCESS_MESSAGE = "Operation successful";
}
```

This structure allows for a clean, maintainable, and scalable way of handling constants.
