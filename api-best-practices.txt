Here are some **best practices for designing API endpoints** across various aspects like application context, versioning, resource naming, and more:

### 1. **Application Context**
   - **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Keep your endpoints as flat as possible. Deeply nested endpoints (`/app/resource1/resource2/resource3`) can be confusing.
   - **Use Clear Base Paths**: Begin each API with a base path that reflects the application context (e.g., `/api` or `/v1/api`).
   
### 2. **Versioning**
   - **Include Versions in the URL**: Use the URL to define versions (e.g., `/v1/`). This makes it clear which version of the API a consumer is using.
   - **Avoid in Headers**: Though versioning in headers is possible, it reduces transparency and discoverability.
   - **Use Major Version Only**: Stick to major versions in the API URL (`/v1`, `/v2`). For minor versions and patches, rely on backward compatibility.

### 3. **Resource Names**
   - **Use Nouns, Not Verbs**: Focus on naming resources as nouns instead of actions (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUser`).
   - **Use Hierarchical Relationships When Necessary**: For related resources, use a hierarchical pattern (`/users/{userId}/orders`).
   
### 4. **Plural Naming**
   - **Use Plurals for Resource Names**: Consistently use plural names for collections of resources (e.g., `/products`, `/orders`).
   - **Singular for Specific Items**: When addressing a specific item, use the singular form with an ID (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).

### 5. **Idempotency**
   - **Safe and Idempotent HTTP Methods**: GET, PUT, and DELETE should be idempotent (repeated requests have the same effect). For example, deleting a resource multiple times shouldn't result in errors after the first successful deletion.
   - **POST is Non-Idempotent**: Use POST for operations like creating new resources.

### 6. **Parameter Handling**
   - **Use Path Parameters for Resources**: Use path parameters for specific resources (`/users/{userId}`).
   - **Query Parameters for Filtering and Pagination**: Use query parameters to filter results, paginate, and sort (`/users?sort=asc&limit=10&offset=20`).

### 7. **Pagination**
   - **Limit and Offset**: Use `limit` and `offset` as query parameters for pagination (`/products?limit=10&offset=30`).
   - **Cursor-Based Pagination**: In cases with many pages, use cursor-based pagination for more efficient handling (`/products?cursor=abc123`).

### 8. **Sorting**
   - **Provide Sorting Capabilities**: Allow clients to request sorting through query parameters (e.g., `/users?sort=name_asc`).
   - **Use Standard Sorting Keys**: Stick to clear, standardized sorting fields like `asc` and `desc`.

### 9. **Filtering**
   - **Use Query Parameters for Filtering**: Use query parameters to filter based on fields (`/products?category=shoes&price_gt=50`).
   - **Use Clear Naming**: Make sure the filter names are self-explanatory and intuitive.

### 10. **Error Handling**
   - **Use HTTP Status Codes Appropriately**: Stick to standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
   - **Provide Error Details**: In the response body, return detailed error messages in a standardized format, typically using JSON or XML.

### 11. **Security**
   - **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all endpoints are protected with HTTPS to encrypt communications.
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement OAuth2, JWT tokens, or other authentication mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs against abuse by rate-limiting the number of requests from clients.

### 12. **Documentation**
   - **Use OpenAPI/Swagger**: Always document your APIs using OpenAPI or Swagger to make them easy for consumers to understand and test.
   - **Keep Documentation Up to Date**: Ensure that API documentation is constantly updated with every version or endpoint change.

### Example API Endpoint Best Practice
Consider an API dealing with users and orders:

```plaintext
GET /v1/users           // Get list of users
GET /v1/users/{userId}   // Get specific user
POST /v1/users          // Create a new user
PUT /v1/users/{userId}   // Update specific user
DELETE /v1/users/{userId} // Delete specific user

GET /v1/users/{userId}/orders  // Get orders for a specific user
GET /v1/orders?limit=20&offset=40 // Paginate through orders
```

These are some key principles and best practices for designing clear, consistent, and robust API endpoints, ensuring maintainability and usability for API consumers.
