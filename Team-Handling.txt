As a team lead, handling a situation where team members are not delivering stories on time requires a balanced approach of empathy, accountability, and problem-solving. Here's how you can handle it diplomatically and effectively:

### 1. **Investigate the Root Cause**:
   - **Schedule a One-on-One**: Talk to the team member privately to understand the reason behind the delays. Ask open-ended questions to uncover if there are challenges such as workload, personal issues, lack of clarity, or technical roadblocks.
   - **Be Empathetic**: Show understanding and support while encouraging honesty. Sometimes external factors, or even burnout, might be affecting their productivity.

### 2. **Clarify Expectations**:
   - **Reiterate Timelines**: Ensure the team member understands the deadlines and the impact delays have on the project and the team. Clearly state the expected timelines and priorities for the tasks.
   - **Define Goals and Responsibilities**: Be specific about what is expected and hold regular check-ins to monitor progress.

### 3. **Offer Support**:
   - **Remove Obstacles**: Ask if there are any blockers you can help with or if they need additional resources, training, or assistance from other team members.
   - **Break Down Tasks**: Sometimes large tasks can feel overwhelming. Work with them to break down the story into smaller, manageable tasks to build momentum.

### 4. **Set Milestones and Follow-ups**:
   - **Create Milestones**: Set smaller, achievable goals with clear deadlines to ensure that progress is happening steadily.
   - **Frequent Check-ins**: Arrange for regular but non-intrusive check-ins to review progress and provide guidance if needed.

### 5. **Provide Constructive Feedback**:
   - **Focus on Improvement**: Offer constructive feedback on how they can manage their time or tasks better. Emphasize growth and development rather than just pointing out the failure to deliver.
   - **Recognize Achievements**: Acknowledge any improvement or effort to meet expectations to encourage positive behavior.

### 6. **Accountability**:
   - **Document Performance**: If this becomes a repeated issue, document the performance and delays for future reference.
   - **Performance Reviews**: If needed, escalate the issue to a formal performance review where clear improvement targets are set.

### 7. **Escalation**:
   - If the delays persist even after your intervention, it may be necessary to escalate the matter to higher management or involve HR for further action. However, this should be a last resort after offering ample support and opportunities for improvement.

By addressing the issue with a combination of understanding and clear expectations, you can maintain a productive and positive team environment while also ensuring accountability.
