Yes, it's highly likely that Transamerica's IT software development unit used Spring Cloud Config Server in conjunction with the centralized repository for managing environment-specific configurations. Here's how this typical setup might work:

### 1. **Centralized Repository**
   - A centralized Git repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) is used to store configuration files.
   - Each branch in the repository corresponds to a different environment (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).
   - In each branch, application-specific configuration files like `myapplication.properties` are stored. These files contain the environment-specific settings for the application.

### 2. **Spring Cloud Config Server**
   - **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config Server is configured to point to the centralized repository. It fetches the appropriate configuration files from the branch corresponding to the environment in which the application is running.
   - **Dynamic Configuration**: The client applications are configured to point to the Config Server. When the application starts, it requests its configuration from the Config Server, which retrieves the correct properties file based on the environment.
   - **Environment-Specific Properties**: The Config Server pulls the relevant configuration file (e.g., `myapplication.properties`) from the appropriate branch (e.g., `production` branch for the production environment).

### 3. **How It Works in Practice**
   - **Environment Branching**: If you have an environment called `production`, you would have a branch named `production` in the repository. In this branch, you would find a `myapplication.properties` file with all the production-specific configurations.
   - **Spring Profiles**: The applications can use Spring profiles (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `development`) to differentiate between environments. The profile would dictate which branch of the centralized repository is accessed via the Config Server.
   - **Automatic Reloading**: If the configuration is updated in the repository, Spring Cloud Config Server can either automatically or manually refresh the configurations without redeploying the applications.

### 4. **Benefits**
   - **Centralized Management**: All configurations are managed in one place, making it easy to update and maintain.
   - **Environment Isolation**: Each environment has its own branch, ensuring that configurations do not accidentally interfere with one another.
   - **Consistency**: Using the same configuration structure across environments reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

### 5. **Possible Implementation**
   - **Git Repository Setup**: A centralized Git repository with branches for each environment.
   - **Config Server Setup**: Spring Cloud Config Server is set up to point to the Git repository.
   - **Client Setup**: Spring Boot applications configured to use Spring Cloud Config to retrieve their configurations at startup based on the active profile.

This setup provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable way to manage configurations across multiple environments, which seems to align with the practices you described at Transamerica.
